<H1>MySQL storage engines</H1>
<P>In this chapter, we will talk about MySQL storage engines. </P>
<P>A storage engine is a software module that a database management system uses 
to create, read, update data from a database. There are two types of storage 
engines in MySQL. Transactional and non-transactional. </P>

<P>The default storage engine for MySQL prior to version 5.5 was MyISAM. For 
MySQL 5.5 and later, the default storage engine is InnoDB. Choosing the right 
storage engine is an important strategic decision, which will impact future 
development. In this tutorial, we will be using MyISAM, InnoDB, Memory and CSV 
storage engines. If you are new to MySQL and your are studying the MySQL 
database management system, then this is not much of a concern. If you are 
planning a production database, then things become more complicated. </P>
<H2 id=list>List of storage engines</H2>
<P>MySQL supported storage engines: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>MyISAM 
  <LI>InnoDB 
  <LI>Memory 
  <LI>CSV 
  <LI>Merge 
  <LI>Archive 
  <LI>Federated 
  <LI>Blackhole 
  <LI>Example </LI></UL>
<P><B>MyISAM</B> is the original storage engine. It is a fast storage engine. It 
does not support transactions. MyISAM provides table-level locking. It is used 
most in Web, data warehousing. </P>
<P><B>InnoDB</B> is the most widely used storage engine with transaction 
support. It is an ACID compliant storage engine. It supports row-level locking, 
crash recovery and multi-version concurrency control. It is the only engine 
which provides foreign key referential integrity constraint. </P>
<P><B>Memory</B> storage engine creates tables in memory. It is the fastest 
engine. It provides table-level locking. It does not support transactions. 
Memory storage engine is ideal for creating temporary tables or quick lookups. 
The data is lost when the database is restarted. </P>
<P><B>CSV</B> stores data in csv files. It provides great flexibility, because 
data in this format is easily integrated into other applications. </P>
<P><B>Merge</B> operates on underlying MyISAM tables. Merge tables help manage 
large volumes of data more easily. It logically groups a series of identical 
MyISAM tables, and references them as one object. Good for data warehousing 
environments. </P>
<P><B>Archive</B> storage engine is optimized for high speed inserting. It 
compresses data as it is inserted. It does not support transactions. It is ideal 
for storing, retrieving large amounts of seldom referenced historical, archived 
data. </P>
<P>The <B>Blackhole</B> storage engine accepts but does not store data. 
Retrievals always return an empty set. The functionality can be used in 
distributed database design where data is automatically replicated, but not 
stored locally. This storage engine can be used to perform performance tests or 
other testing. </P>
<P><B>Federated</B> storage engine offers the ability to separate MySQL servers 
to create one logical database from many physical servers. Queries on the local 
server are automatically executed on the remote (federated) tables. No data is 
stored on the local tables. It is good for distributed environments. </P>
<H2 id=choose>Choosing the right engine</H2>
<P>No storage engine is ideal for all circumstances. Some perform best under 
certain conditions and perform worse in other situations. There are tradeoffs 
than must be considered. A more secure solution takes more resources. It might 
be slower, take more CPU time and disk space. MySQL is very flexible in the fact 
that it provides several different storage engines. Some of them, like the 
Archive engine, are created to be used in specific situations. Ironically this 
also brings a question, which storage engine to use? Which may not be easily 
answered. </P>
<P>In some cases, the answer is clear. Whenever we are dealing with some payment 
systems, we are obliged to use the most secure solution. We cannot afford to 
loose such sensitive data. InnoDB is the way to go. If we want full-text search, 
than we must choose MyISAM. Only InnoDB supports foreign key referential 
integrity constraint and if we plan to use this constraint, then the choice is 
clear. In many situations we must have enough experience to choose the right 
engine. And if we lack the experience, than the best way is to ask some seasoned 
developer. One of the best ways is to ask on specific internet forums. <A 
href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</A> is a great one. The 
question is further complicated by the fact, that we can choose different 
storage engines for different tables. </P>
<H2 id=specalt>Specifying and altering storage engines</H2>
<P>The storage engine is specified at the time of the table creation. </P><PRE class=code>mysql&gt; CREATE TABLE Cars(Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(50), 
    -&gt; Cost INTEGER) ENGINE='MyISAM';
</PRE>
<P>The <CODE>ENGINE</CODE> keyword specifies the storage engine used for this 
particular table. </P>
<P>If we do not specify the storage engine explicitly, then the default storage 
engine is used. Prior to MySQL 5.5 the default storage engine was MyISAM. For 
MySQL 5.5 and later, the default storage engine is InnoDB. </P><PRE class=code>mysql&gt; SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'storage_engine';
+----------------+--------+
| Variable_name  | Value  |
+----------------+--------+
| storage_engine | InnoDB |
+----------------+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</PRE>
<P>The default storage engine can be found in the <CODE>storage_engine</CODE> 
variable. </P>
<P>It is possible to migrate to a different storage engine. Note that migrating 
a large table might take a long time. Also we might run into some problems when 
migrating tables. Some features might not be supported in both tables. </P><PRE class=code>mysql&gt; SELECT ENGINE FROM information_schema.TABLES
    -&gt; WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='mydb'
    -&gt; AND TABLE_NAME='Cars';
+--------+
| ENGINE |
+--------+
| InnoDB |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</PRE>
<P>This SQL statement finds out the storage engine used for a Cars table in mydb 
database. We could also use <CODE>SELECT CREATE TABLE Cars</CODE> SQL statement. 
The <CODE>information_schema</CODE> is a table which stores technical 
information about our tables. </P><PRE class=code>mysql&gt; ALTER TABLE Cars ENGINE='MyISAM';
</PRE>
<P>This SQL statement changes the storage engine to MyISAM. </P><PRE class=code>mysql&gt; SELECT ENGINE FROM information_schema.TABLES
    -&gt; WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='mydb'
    -&gt; AND TABLE_NAME='Cars';
+--------+
| ENGINE |
+--------+
| MyISAM |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</PRE>
<P>Now the storage engine is MyISAM. </P>
<P>In this part of the MySQL tutorial, we have covered storage engines. </P>
