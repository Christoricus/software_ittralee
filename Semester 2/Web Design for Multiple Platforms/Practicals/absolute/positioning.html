<p>It was a distressing time; and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the oldest orphan, 
had to bear the brunt of it. But this particular first Wednesday, like its 
predecessors, finally dragged itself to a close.</p>

<p>Jerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been making sandwiches for the 
asylum's guests, and turned upstairs to accomplish her regular work. Her 
special care was room F, where eleven little tots, from four to seven, occupied 
eleven little cots set in a row. </p>

<p>Jerusha assembled her charges, straightened their rumpled frocks, wiped their 
noses, and started them in an orderly and willing line towards the dining-room 
to engage themselves for a blessed half hour with bread and milk and prune pudding.</p>
