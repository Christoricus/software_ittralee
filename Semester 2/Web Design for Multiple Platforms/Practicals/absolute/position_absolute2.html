<!-- begin the content box -->

<div class="content">
  <h1>This is the content for my page.</h1>
	<p>This page represents an example of how to use CSS for positioning. There
    are four basic ways that you can position elements in CSS. By default, elements
    remain in the flow (also called static positioning), which means that they
    simply appear on the page as they appear in the .html. Second, you can position
    elements absolutely, which means that they are taken out of the flow and
    positioned with respect to their parent element. Third, you can use a fixed
    position, which means the box is taken out of the flow and positioned relative
    to the browser window. Fourth, is relative positioning, which means the elments
    are positioned with respect to where they would have appeared in the default
    flow.</p>
	<h2>This is more content for my page.</h2>
	<p>So that I can illustrate what happens when you scroll up and down the page
	and also to illustrate what happens when you resize the browser window I am
	adding more content. If you use a fixed positioning, scrolling up and down
	has an interesting effect in that elements that are fixed will remain in the
	window, while others will scroll up and down. If you resize the window it
	will have an impact on elements that have been sized or positioned with percentage
	since they will grow and shrink with respect to the browser window (&quot;liquid
	layout&quot;), while elements that are sized or positioned absolutely, will
	not shrink.</p>

<!-- begin the menu box -->

<div class="menu">
	<strong>This is my Menu</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>This is a menu item</li>
		<li>This is a menu item</li>
		<li>This is a menu item</li>
		<li>This is a menu item</li>
	</ul>
