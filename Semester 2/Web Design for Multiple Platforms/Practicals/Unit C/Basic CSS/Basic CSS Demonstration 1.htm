Impact on Creative Expression and Critical Thinking</h1>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;font-size:13pt">
The ability to share ideas via the Internet is providing users an
unrivaled vehicle for creative expression. No longer dependent upon
publishers, mass media, and other traditional distribution channels,
thousands of writers, poets, scientists, musicians, students, and
others are making their work available to others around the globe. The
existing latent creative talent
surfacing in the exchanges of the Internet confirms that as individuals
we have
not yet become nearly as passive or simple-minded as critics of our
society,
and our education system, would lead us to believe. On the contrary,
given this
vehicle for being heard, individuals of all ages are engaging in
complex,
educational, and highly creative interchanges.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;font-size:13pt">
In order to prepare themselves for these interchanges,
students at all skill levels are demonstrating an increased interest in
reading and writing. Students who believe their work will be read by a
truly interested audience excel in writing above their individual past
performance levels; they learn quickly that in order to be understood,
they must express themselves clearly and rise to the challenge.
Similarly, students receiving information they have requested or
specifically searched for often read above their past skill level with
great
determination; these students care about the information before them
and find
purpose and reward in working hard to comprehend even difficult
materials.</p>

<p style="text-indent:25px;font-size:13pt">Teachers and students exploring the Internet together are
developing skills for questioning, researching, analyzing, discussing,
hypothesizing, and proposing. These capabilities are gradually
replacing the traditionally valued skills of objectification and
memorization. As students and teachers together learn to become more
creative, the Internet provides them a mechanism through which they can
share their enthusiasm and discoveries with others. In this scenario,
the
networked classroom becomes a place where information is viewed as a
starting point, critical thinking is essential, and creative
application of information is the key to learning.</p>
