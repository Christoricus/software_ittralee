      <h2 class="maintext">About Us</h2>
      <p class="maintext">Lakeland Reeds is an ideal place to unplug from your daily routine, whether on the shore of Twin Lakes watching the sundown over the cattails or just curled up in a hammock on our screened wraparound porch with a good book.  Breakfast is ready whenever you are, and we're happy to accommodate a wide range of appetites, from comfort food like sausage and biscuits to the lighter end of things, such as egg white omelettes and fresh fruit.</p>
      <p class="maintext">We're here to help you get the most out of your time with us, from canoes and life vests for a day out on the lake, to DVDs and popcorn for a quiet evening in. We look forward to welcoming you!</p>
