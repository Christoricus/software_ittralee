Lakeland Reeds Bed and Breakfast
About UsLakeland Reeds is an ideal place to unplug from your daily routine, whether on the shore of Twin Lakes watching the sundown over the cattails or just curled up in a hammock on our screened wraparound porch with a good book. Breakfast is ready whenever you are, and we're happy to accommodate a wide range of appetites, from comfort food like sausage and biscuits to the lighter end of things, such as egg white omelettes and fresh fruit.
We're here to help you get the most out of your time with us, from canoes and life vests for a day out on the lake, to DVDs and popcorn for a quiet evening in. We look forward to welcoming you!
