<div class="llumi">
<h1>llumi, the huntress</h1>
<p>llumi is our sweet, but <em>ferocious</em> hunter-kitty. maybe it's because she was born out in the wild (ok, the parking lot of the
 <a href="commonwealth.htm">place my brother-in-law works</a>) 
 or maybe because she was an orphan (he found her when she and her six brothers and 
 sisters were just two days old.)</p>
</div>
<div class="xixo">
<h1>xixona, the hungry </h1>
<p>xixona, we call her xixo (pronounced shi-shoe) for short, 
looks like a carbon-copy of her mother, <a href="cookie.html">cookie</a>, 
if a bit darker. it's very easy to tell them apart, though</p>
