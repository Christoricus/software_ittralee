<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>&#8220;There was a time not that long ago when many drivers thought
nothing of tossing empty bottles out the windows of their cars. Years
later, these same citizens came to realize that littering was not an
acceptable way to dispose of their trash. The web design community is
now undergoing a similar shift in attitude. Web standards are key to
this transformation.&#8221; &#8212; <cite>Designing With Web Standards</cite></p>
