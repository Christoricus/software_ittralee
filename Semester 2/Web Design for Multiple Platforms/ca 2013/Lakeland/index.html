      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <p><a href="http://www.lakedistrictcottages.me.uk/">Lakeland Reeds</a> is an ideal place to unplug from your daily routine, whether on the shore of Twin Lakes watching the sunset over the cattails, or just curled up in a hammock on our wraparound porch with a good book. <a href="../Menus/Breakfast.html"> Breakfast </a>is ready whenever you are, and we're happy to accommodate a wide range of appetites, from comfort food, like sausage and biscuits, to the lighter end of things, such as egg white omelettes and fresh fruit.</p>
      Lakeland  offers a great accommodation:<ul>
<li>All rooms en-suite</li>
<li>Tea/coffee making facilities</li>
<li>TV in every room</li>
<li>Private Parking</li>
</ul>

      <p>We're here to help you get the most out of your time with us, from canoes and life vests for a day out on the lake, to popcorn and a DVD of The Wizard of Oz for a quiet evening in. We look forward to welcoming you!</p>
