<h1>Here be dragons...</h1>
<p>This is a <a href="#">Problem &amp; Workaround Set</a> for a series of <a href="#">CSS 
Boxes</a> going from a simple single box, through 3 columns with a full width 
top box, all with variations.</p>
<p>There are also some relevant <a href="#">content 
placement issues</a> that affect box positioning, a little gem of a <a href="#">bg 
image problem</a> or two, and my own explanation of <a href="#">what 
it's all about</a>.</p>
<p>What this isn't, is a how-to for CSS layout. This is a how-to for dealing 
with the misinterpretations of our current browsers. If you're new to CSS, <a 
href="#">this</a> is a better place to start.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p><br />

<h1>CAVEAT - a Warning and an Explanation</h1>
<p>Box Lessons was written way back in 2001. In CSS terms that's nearly 
archaic.</p>
<p>At that time, CSS was not used for positioning. Browser support was either 
poor or impossibly flawed, as with the then-popular Netscape 4.</p>
<p>This was bad because instead of using CSS, web designers misused table tags 
to achieve layout. Which failed in anything but the latest browsers for home 
computer screens -- it was no good for audio readers, cell phones, or really 
anything other than IE and Netscape. Which was completely at odds with the whole 
"write once, read anywhere" point of the web.</p>
