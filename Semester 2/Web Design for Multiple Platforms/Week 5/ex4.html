Mr Lavrov said Russia has no authority over pro-Russian forces that have taken de-facto control of the Crimean Peninsula.

"If they are the self-defence forces created by the inhabitants of Crimea, we have no authority over them," he said.

"They do not receive our orders ... However, the Russian military of the Black Sea fleet are in their deployment places and some special alert and control measures have been taken of the whole Black Sea fleet."

Mr Lavrov also told reporters that Russia would not allow violence to erupt in Ukraine.

"We will not allow bloodshed. We will not allow attempts against the lives and well-being of those who live in Ukraine and Russian citizens who live in Ukraine," he said.

Ukrainian troops remain blocked inside their barracks in Crimea in the gravest stand-off between the West and Russia since the end of the Cold War.

The US-UK-Russian talks in Paris will follow a conference attended by all five permanent members of the UN Security Council. NATO and Russia will hold parallel talks in Brussels.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague has warned he is "not optimistic" of making progress on the crisis when he meets Mr Lavrov with Mr Kerry.

Mr Hague said the discussions would be a "test" of whether Russia was ready to make concessions to defuse the situation.

But he said there was little sign that Russia would agree to set up a "contact group" for direct talks with the government in Kiev.

"I am not optimistic about the outcome of that but of course it is right to try every diplomatic opportunity to de-escalate the crisis," he told reporters in the French capital.

"If we cannot make progress on that of course there will be costs and consequences ... there has to be for such a violation of the independence and sovereignty of another nation."
