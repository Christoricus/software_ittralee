	<h1>This is the content for my page.</h1>
	<p>This page represents an example of how to use CSS for positioning. There are four basic ways that you can position elements in CSS. 
	By default, elements remain in the flow (also called static positioning), which means that they simply appear on the page as they 
	appear in the .html. Second, you can position elements absolutely, which means that they are taken out of the flow and 
	positioned with respect to their parent element. Third, you can use a fixed position, which means the box is taken out 
	of the flow and positioned relative to the browser window. Fourth, is relative positioning, which means the elments are positioned
	with respect to where they would have appeared in the default flow.</p>
	
	<h2>This is more content for my page.</h2>
	<p>So that I can illustrate what happens when you scroll up and down the page and also to illustrate what happens when you resize the 
	browser window I am adding more content. If you use a fixed positioning, scrolling up and down has an interesting effect in that 
	elements that are fixed will remain in the window, while others will scroll up and down. If you resize the window it will have 
	an impact on elements that have been sized or positioned with percentage since they will grow and shrink with respect to the 
	browser window ("liquid layout"), while elements that are sized or positioned absolutely, will not shrink.</p>
