Create an array that contains the titles of 4 
courses - you hard code this in.

Create a seperate array that takes the student 
numbers on each of these courses. 
We are presuming that the user enters these
in the same order as the first array.

Find the largest number in the students 
array and using the index of that value output 
the course title from the first array.
