//Practical 6 Exercise 3

(a)

Draft 1 of the Pseudocode here could be:

  do
        Display menu options
 	Prompt for users choice
        Read in users choice
        
  	if users choice is 1
	    determine area of a cylinder
	else if users choice is 2 
            determine area of a semicircle
	else if users choice is 3 
    	    determine area of a triangle
	else if users choice is 4 
 	    quit the system
	else 
    	    display error message
    		
   while (choice is not 4)
   
   Display a farewell message 	


(b)

Refinements to draft 1 of the pseudocode here could be:

The pseudocode to determine area of a cylinder could be refined as follows:

prompt for the radius of cylinder
read in the radius of cylinder
prompt for the height of cylinder
read in the height of cylinder
set the area of cylinder to  3.14 x radius x radius x height
display area of cylinder

The pseudocode to determine area of a semicircle could be refined as follows:

prompt for the radius of semicircle
read in the radius of semicircle
set the area of semicircle is  (3.14 x radius x radius)/2
display area of semicircle

The pseudocode to determine area of a triangle could be refined as follows:

prompt for the base length of triangle
read in the base length of triangle
prompt for the height of triangle
read in the height of triangle
area of triangle is  (base x height)/2
display area of triangle



There are no further refinements necessary


(c)

The pseudocode for the methods is as follows:


------------------------------------------------------------------
The method definition header for the displayMenu() method is

void displayMenu()

since the purpose of the method is just to display information to the screen. 
It returns nothing to main(). It just consists of display messages which show 
appropriate information.

no further refinements are necessary here

The final pseudocode for this method is:

void displayMenu()
	Display menu options

-------------------------------------------------------------------


The method definition header for the cylinderArea() method is

void cylinderArea()

The purpose of the method is to prompt the user for radius and height of 
cylinder and use it to determine its area. It outputs this value and returns 
nothing to main().

The pseudocode for the method is:

 
void cylinderArea()
	prompt for the radius of cylinder
	read in the radius of cylinder
	prompt for the height of cylinder
	read in the height of cylinder
	set the area of cylinder to  3.14 x radius x radius x height
	display area of cylinder

no further refinements are necessary here

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The method definition header for the semicircleArea() method is

void semicircleArea()

The purpose of the method is to prompt the user for radius of semicircle and use it 
to determine its area. It outputs this value and returns nothing to main().


The pseudocode for the method is:
void semicircleArea()
	prompt for the radius of semicircle
	read in the radius of semicircle
	set the area of semicircle is  (3.14 x radius x radius)/2
	display area of semicircle

no further refinements are necessary here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The method definition header for the triangleArea() method is

void triangleArea()

The purpose of the method is to prompt the user for base and height of triangle and use
these to determine its area. It outputs this value and returns nothing to main() 

The pseudocode for the method is:

void triangleArea()
	prompt for the base length of triangle
	read in the base length of triangle
	prompt for the height of triangle
	read in the height of triangle
	area of triangle is  (base x height)/2
	display area of triangle


no further refinements are necessary here
