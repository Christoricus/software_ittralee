<CENTER><H1>Complex plane</H1>
</CENTER><BR>
<P>
This applet illustrates the complex plane (sometimes called the
Argand plane in older books), which can be used to display complex
numbers, in the same way the real line is used to display real numbers.
<P>
The red dot on the plane represents a complex number <TT>z</TT>.
The number <TT>z</TT> is usually expressed in Cartesian form <TT>x+yi</TT>,
or in Polar form <TT>r exp(i theta)</TT>.  On the bottom of the applet
you can see both forms of expression.
<P>
There are several ways to move <TT>z</TT> around.  One is simply
to click on the grid.  Another is to manually change the <TT>x</TT>
and <TT>y</TT> co-ordinates (or the <TT>r</TT> and <TT>theta</TT> 
co-ordinates).  Note that you have to press "Enter" in order
to process any change in these co-ordinates.  You do not
need to enter the "pi" when altering the <TT>theta</TT> co-ordinate.
The "&lt" and ">" buttons decrement and increment these four
co-ordinates by a fixed amount.
<P>
Finally, you can move <TT>z</TT> around by pressing one of the
buttons on the top of the applet.  For instance, the <TT>2z</TT>
button replaces <TT>z</TT> by <TT>2z</TT>; i.e. it doubles the
complex number.  The <TT>3+2i</TT> button sends you to the complex
number <TT>3+2i</TT> no matter what <TT>z</TT> is.  And so forth.
Note that the <TT>1/z</TT> button is disabled when <TT>z</TT> is zero.
<P>
To test your knowledge of complex arithmetic, place the
dot at a random location, select a random button, and see if
you can predict where the dot is going to go.
