		<p>Minister for Health James Reilly has called on insurers to absorb the cost of stamp duty increases and not add them to the health cover premiums of younger people.
		Yesterday Dr Reilly announced a number of rule changes announced which, coupled with budget reductions in tax relief on premiums, are expected to see premiums increase by approximately 15 per cent.
		An average family with two children will pay an extra &euro;328 in premiums next year as a result of yesterday's change and the budget cuts in tax relief, insurer GloHealth estimated.
		Laya healthcare added that the move would drive more people out of private health insurance.

		Speaking today Dr Reilly said an average of 60,000 people per annum had abandoned their private health insurance and admitted that in the longer term this was unsustainable.
		He called on insurers to accept a lower profit margin on their younger, healthier customers and not to pass on the increases to this age group in a bid to prevent them surrendering their policies.
		Dr Reilly suggested that some insurers were "cherry-pickin" customers and as a result had a far lower proportion of older customers than their market share.
