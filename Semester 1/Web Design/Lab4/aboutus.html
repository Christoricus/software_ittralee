<h1>Lakeland Reeds Bed and Breakfast</h1>
<h2 class="box">About Us</h2>
<p class="box">Lakeland Reeds is an ideal place to unplug from your daily routine, whether on the shore of Twin Lakes watching the sundown over the cattails or just curled up in a hammock on our screened wraparound porch with a good book. Breakfast is ready whenever you are, and we're happy to accommodate a wide range of appetites, from comfort food like sausage and biscuits to the lighter end of things, such as egg white omelettes and fresh fruit.</p>
<p class="box">We're here to help you get the most out of your time with us, from canoes and life vests for a day out on the lake, to DVDs and popcorn for a quiet evening in. We look forward to welcoming you! </p>
